<h1>Winch and 2nd Buoy Package</h1>
<p>For the second buoy, we decided to drop a package with temperature and DO sensor to take a vertical profile of the lake. We didn't finish the winch in time to test at the lake, but during the last week of COSMOS, we were able to set up a cable to recieve data from these sensors and we set up a motor for the winch. </p>
