<p>The Science Team worked to use radios, GPS, and sensors (pH, TDS, ORP, and Dissolved Oxygen) to make a buoy that attaches to the USVs, collects data from the water, and sends that data to the database via radio. We also attempted to send sensors underwater using a winch to collect data from different depths. </p>
