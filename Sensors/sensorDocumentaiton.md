<h1>Sensors</h1>
<p>The sensors that we used in our project during the last lake test were pH, temperature, ORP, and Dissolved Oxygen. To start off, we used parts of the example code  for the sensors, and then modified it to fit our purposes. Although all of the sensors worked individually, integrating them for the buoy was challenging, and there were problems with the radio sending and recieving the data. </p>
