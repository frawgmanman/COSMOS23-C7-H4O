# UCSD COSMOS 2023 Cluster 7 - H4O: Hacking for Oceans
<h4>Science Team: Cynthia, Tavisha, Sebastian, Ethan, Harjyot, Anastasia </h4>
<p>The Science Team worked to use radios, GPS, and sensors (pH, TDS, ORP, and Dissolved Oxygen) to make a buoy that attaches to the USVs, collects data from the water, and sends that data to the database via radio. We also attempted to send sensors underwater using a winch to collect data from different depths. </p>
<p> The code that we used for our sensors can be found in the "Sensors" folder, code for the radio can be found in "telemetry", code for the winch can be found in "testing", and the code that puts all the pieces of our buoy together can be found in the main folder.</p>
